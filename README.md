# INST326_Garden_Sim Group D

**Purpose**

garden_simulator.py - The main file of the project that allows the user to simulate a garden via the command line.


garden_simulator_test.py - The main file that we use for testing our code.


plants.csv - The csv file containing 
README.md - A read me file that explains the purpose and how to use the program.


**How to Run garden_simulator.py**

All you need to do to run our program is to put in the terminal: 

      python garden_simulator.py

You will be prompted to choose a plant, the options displayed in the prompt. Enter your chosen plant and the program should run from there. 
      
**How to Use Program or Interpret Results**

First you want to plant a plant in the garden with the garden function.
Then you can water the plant with the water method.
After this you can harvest the plant using the harvest function.
You can also check the environment, ph, and sunlight of a given plant with their respective commands (their names are the commands)
If the plant's HP isn't at 100, you cannot harvest, but if it is you are allowed to. 
Planting more than five plants in the garden results in an message error.
